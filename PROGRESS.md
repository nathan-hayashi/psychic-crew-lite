# PROGRESS.md — compaction-safe checkpoints

## [L0|2026-08-21T15:06:29Z] L0 SCAFFOLD COMPLETE
- **Repo created** at a sibling path, branch `dev`, per §8 Q1 (separate repo).
- **Config:** `models.config.json` with capability classes (deep/standard/economy) resolving to aliases — CR-029 folded in as ruled. `apply-models.sh` follows all three hops and scans the RESOLVED value.
- **Four agent bodies**, 22–36 lines each, at contract parity with the parent's best.
- **Rules:** `security.md` and `fallback-protocol.md` MIRRORED byte-identical; `model-policy.md` ADAPTED for classes; `release-protocol.md` NEW, replacing the parent's arbiter protocol.
- **Sync correlation** map and its check — 15 PASS / 0 FAIL, both directions controlled.
- **Next action:** await `APPROVE GATE-L0` to close L0. L1 is enforcement: hooks, deny-list, model guard, secrets guard, release-audit trail.
